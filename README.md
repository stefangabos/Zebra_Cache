# Zebra Cache &nbsp;[![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/http/shields.io.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A+file-based+lightweight+PHP+caching+library+that+uses+file+locking+to+ensure+proper+functionality+under+heavy+load&url=https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Cache&via=stefangabos&hashtags=php,cache)

*A lightweight and flexible PHP caching library with support for file, Redis, and Memcached storage backends.*

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/stefangabos/zebra_cache/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/stefangabos/zebra_cache) [![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/stefangabos/zebra_cache/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/stefangabos/zebra_cache) [![Monthly Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/stefangabos/zebra_cache/d/monthly)](https://packagist.org/packages/stefangabos/zebra_cache) [![Daily Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/stefangabos/zebra_cache/d/daily)](https://packagist.org/packages/stefangabos/zebra_cache) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/stefangabos/zebra_cache/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/stefangabos/zebra_cache)

It supports common caching operations such as storing, retrieving and deleting data, as well as checking for the existence of a cache entry.

## Features

- pluggable architecture for using different storage mechanisms
- flexible key-value caching
- automatic expiration of cache items based on a specified time-to-live (TTL) value
- extensible design allowing developers to integrate new storage backends
- easy-to-use API with consistent behavior across different backends
- support for multiple instances, allowing you to use different cache configurations for different parts of your application

## Requirements

PHP 7.0.0+

Use version [1.3.2](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_Cache/releases/tag/1.3.2) if you need support for PHP 5.3.0+

## Installation

You can install via [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/stefangabos/zebra_cache)

```bash
# get the latest stable release
composer require stefangabos/zebra_cache

# get the latest commit
composer require stefangabos/zebra_cache:dev-master
```

## How to use

Initializing **file-based storage**:

```php
// make sure you have this at the top of your script
use stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Zebra_Cache;
use stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Storage\Storage_File;

// initialize file-based storage
$storage = new Storage_File('/path/to/cache/folder');
```

Initializing **Redis-based storage**:

```php
// make sure you have this at the top of your script
use stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Zebra_Cache;
use stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Storage\Storage_Redis;

// connect to a Redis server
$redis = new Redis();
$redis->connect('127.0.0.1', 6379);

// pass the $redis instance as argument to initialize the Redis-based storage
$storage = new Storage_Redis($redis);

// finally, instantiate the caching library using the storage engine configured above
$cache = new stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Zebra_Cache($storage);
```

Initializing **Memcached-based storage**:

There are two PHP extensions for working with [Memcached](https://memcached.org/): the [memcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcache.php) extension, which is older and less commonly used, and [memcached](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) which is generally preferred for better features and compatibility.
This library supports both.

```php
// make sure you have this at the top of your script
use stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Zebra_Cache;
use stefangabos\Zebra_Cache\Storage\Storage_Memcached;

// connect to a Memcached server (using the `memcached` extension)
$memcache = new Memcached();
$memcache->addServer('localhost', 11211);

// OR using the `memcache` extension
$memcache = new Memcache();
$memcache->addServer('localhost', 11211);

// pass the $memcache instance as argument to initialize the Memcached-based storage
$storage = new Storage_Memcached($memcache);
```

Once the storage engine is initialized:

```php
// instantiate the caching library using the chosen storage engine
$cache = new Zebra_Cache($storage);

// if a cached, non-expired value for the sought key does not exist
if (!($my_data = $cache->get('my-key'))) {

    // do whatever you need to retrieve data
    $my_data = 'my data';

    // cache the values for one 10 minutes (10 x 60 seconds)
    $cache->set('my-key', $my_data, 10 * 600);

}

// at this point $my_data will always contain data, either from cache, or fresh
```

### Getting information about cached data

```php
if ($info = $cache->has('my-key')) {

    print_r('<pre>');
    print_r($info);

    // for file-based storage the output will look something like
    // [
    //  'path'     => '',  //  path to the cache file
    //  'timeout'  => '',  //  the number of seconds the cache was supposed to be valid
    //  'ttl'      => '',  //  number of seconds remaining until the cache expires
    // ]

}
```

### Deleting cached data

```php
$cache->delete('my-key');
```
